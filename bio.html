        <h4>
            <p>Born and raised in Springfield, Ohio I have lived most of my life here with the exception of a four year stint in the United States Navy.
                I was stationed in San Diego and did a West-Pac deployment where we stopped in Australia, Thailand, U.A.E, Jordan, Djibouti and Ethiopia.
                This experience, I believe, was second to none and is a big part of why I am who I am.  I was honorably discharged in 2012 and came back 
                to Ohio where I worked a few different jobs.  Before I decided to take the plunge into a coding bootcamp I had worked as a HVAC & Commercial
                Refrigeration tech for two years.  This job left me physically sore and wanting more for myself at the end of every workday.  I wanted more
                of a challenge because I knew I could achieve more. Thats how I got to this point...
